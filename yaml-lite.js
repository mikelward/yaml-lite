// A hand-rolled parser for exactly the YAML subset GitHub Actions workflow
// files use — block mappings, block and flow sequences, plain/quoted
// scalars, and literal/folded block scalars. Nothing else: no anchors,
// aliases, tags, multi-document streams, or complex (multi-line) flow
// mappings. Encountering one of those is a bug in this parser's scope, not
// a thing to guess at, so it throws rather than silently returning
// something wrong.
//
// This is the canonical copy. It originated in mikelward/ci-commit-artifact,
// was ported "verbatim" into mikelward/npm-update, and the two copies then
// drifted independently for a while — ci-commit-artifact gained
// duplicate-key detection, __proto__ safety, tag/reserved-character/quote/
// bracket validation and empty-flow-sequence-element rejection; npm-update
// independently gained the "more than one separation space after a sequence
// dash" fix. This file merges both lines of fixes back into one, so there is
// exactly one parser other repos vendor a copy of, not two that quietly
// disagree. If you find a bug or a gap here, fix it here first, then sync
// the copies in every consumer (see this repo's own AGENTS.md).
//
// Exists so a consuming repo's tests can assert real structure instead of
// regex/string-matching over serialized YAML text. That fragility is exactly
// what motivated this: a "no expression is spliced into any run: block"
// sweep written as a block-boundary regex couldn't reliably tell a run:
// script line from an env: declaration or a with: input, and needed several
// rounds of exclusion patches to stop false-positiving on its own fixes.
// Kept in-process and dependency-free on purpose, matching every consumer's
// "no dependencies, no package.json, no lockfile" rule: shelling out to
// python3 for a real YAML parser (PyYAML, as mikelward/codex-review's
// check_consumer.py does) would be a second runtime taken on for test-time
// convenience, not a structural need the way it is there.
//
// Deliberately does NOT implement YAML 1.1's `on`/`off`/`yes`/`no`-as-boolean
// expansion (only `true`/`false`/`null`/`~` are recognized) — that quirk is
// exactly what makes a bare `on:` trigger key read as the boolean `true` in
// a spec-following YAML 1.1 parser (PyYAML included), which every GitHub
// Actions workflow then has to work around. Skipping it here isn't a
// compatibility gap; a workflow's `on:` key means the literal word "on" to
// every tool that actually reads these files, GitHub's own parser included.

function parseWorkflowYaml(text) {

  // "nothing after the final newline", not a genuine blank line the
  // document's author typed. Everywhere else that synthetic element is
  // harmless (it's blank, so the structural view below already skips it),
  // but parseBlockScalar consumes rawLines directly by raw indentation, and
  // a block scalar running to the true end of the document would swallow it
  // as if it were one more real trailing blank line — inflating `collected`
  // and, for `+` (keep) chomping specifically, changing the result. Caught
  // by a document ending exactly "...x\n" with no line after the block

  // every block scalar — a blank line or a full-line comment, both excluded
  // from `structural` — was never visited by anything at all (accepting a
  // tab real YAML rejects), and separately a blank line WITHIN a block
  // scalar was skipped by an `!line.isBlank` guard before establishing or
