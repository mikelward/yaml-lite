// A hand-rolled parser for exactly the YAML subset GitHub Actions workflow
// files use — block mappings, block and flow sequences, plain/quoted
// scalars, and literal/folded block scalars. Nothing else: no anchors,
// aliases, tags, multi-document streams, or complex (multi-line) flow
// mappings. Encountering one of those is a bug in this parser's scope, not
// a thing to guess at, so it throws rather than silently returning
// something wrong.
//
// This is the canonical copy. It originated in mikelward/ci-commit-artifact,
// was ported "verbatim" into mikelward/npm-update, and the two copies then
// drifted independently for a while — ci-commit-artifact gained
// duplicate-key detection, __proto__ safety, tag/reserved-character/quote/
// bracket validation and empty-flow-sequence-element rejection; npm-update
// independently gained the "more than one separation space after a sequence
// dash" fix. This file merges both lines of fixes back into one, so there
// is exactly one parser, not two that quietly disagree. Consumers no
// longer vendor copies at all: their CI checks this repository out at
// @main and their test suites resolve the parser from that checkout (a
// sibling clone locally) — so a fix here reaches every consumer's next CI
// run with nothing to sync. Fix bugs and gaps here, only here.
//
// Exists so a consuming repo's tests can assert real structure instead of
// regex/string-matching over serialized YAML text. That fragility is exactly
// what motivated this: a "no expression is spliced into any run: block"
// sweep written as a block-boundary regex couldn't reliably tell a run:
// script line from an env: declaration or a with: input, and needed several
// rounds of exclusion patches to stop false-positiving on its own fixes.
// Kept in-process and dependency-free on purpose, matching every consumer's
// "no dependencies, no package.json, no lockfile" rule: shelling out to
// python3 for a real YAML parser (PyYAML, as mikelward/codex-review's
// check_consumer.py does) would be a second runtime taken on for test-time
// convenience, not a structural need the way it is there.
//
// Deliberately does NOT implement YAML 1.1's `on`/`off`/`yes`/`no`-as-boolean
// expansion (only `true`/`false`/`null`/`~` are recognized) — that quirk is
// exactly what makes a bare `on:` trigger key read as the boolean `true` in
// a spec-following YAML 1.1 parser (PyYAML included), which every GitHub
// Actions workflow then has to work around. Skipping it here isn't a
// compatibility gap; a workflow's `on:` key means the literal word "on" to
// every tool that actually reads these files, GitHub's own parser included.
